✓ DONE: The environment mutation issue (fixed in commit 7128aa2 - top-level setq vars are now mutable)

TODO:
1. Separate function definitions into boxed and non-boxed interfaces
   - Modules calling their own functions should use unboxed interface for better performance

2. Fix REPL incomplete S-expression handling
   - Pressing enter on an incomplete sexp incorrectly returns nil instead of continuing input

3. Generate more comprehensive tests
